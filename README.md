# Food-Vision-using-EfficientNetB4-and-ResNet50
I have trained a machine learning model to classify food images using the Food101 dataset with 101,000+ images across 101 categories.Using transfer learning with EfficientNet and ResNet, I ensured fast and accurate results.The model runs on a Flask backend, with a HTML/CSS frontend for user-friendly image uploads.
